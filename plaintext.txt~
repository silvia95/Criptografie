“I am a strange old man” 
“But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?” 
“I think so. And there are many tricks.” 
[14] “Let us take the stuff home,” the boy said. 
“So I can get the cast net and go after the 
sardines.” 
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the 
boy carried the wooden boat with
 the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and the harpoon 
with its shaft. The box with the baits was under th
e stern of the skiff along with the club that was 
used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the old 
man but it was better to take the sail and the he
avy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, 
though he was quite sure no local people would steal 
from him, the old man thought that a gaff and 
a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat. 
They walked up the road together to the old 
man’s shack and went in through its open door. 
The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail
 against the wall and the boy put the box and the 
other gear beside it. The 
mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made 
of the tough budshields of the ro
yal palm which are called guano and 
in it there was a bed, a table, 
one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to cook wi
th charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, 
overlapping leaves of the sturdy 
fibered [15] guano there was a pictu
re in color of the Sacred Heart 
of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobre. Thes
e were relics of his wife. Once there had been a 
tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had 
taken it down because it made him too lonely 
to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt. 
“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked. 
“A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?” 
“No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?” 
“No. I will make it later on. 
Or I may eat the rice cold.” 
“May I take the cast net?” 
“Of course.” 
There was no cast net and the boy remembered 
when they had sold it. But they went through 
this fiction every day. There was no pot of ye
llow rice and fish and the boy knew this too. 
“Eighty-five is a lucky number,” the old man sa
id. “How would you like to see me bring one in 
that dressed out over a thousand pounds?” 
“I’ll get the cast net and go for sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?” 
[16] “Yes. I have yesterday’s pape
r and I will read the baseball.” 
The boy did not know whether yesterday’s paper wa
s a fiction too. But the old man brought it 
out from under the bed. 
“Perico gave it to me at the bodega,” he explaine
d. “I’ll be back when I have the sardines. I’ll 
keep yours and mine together on 
ice and we can share them in the morning. When I come back you 
can tell me about the baseball.” 
“The Yankees cannot lose.” 
“But I fear the Indians of Cleveland.” 
“Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio.” 
“I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland.” 
“Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sax of Chicago.” 
“You study it and tell me when I come back.” 
“Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the 
eighty-fifth day.” 
“We can do that,” the boy said. “But what a
bout the eighty-seven of your great record?” 
[17] “It could not happen twice. Do you 
think you can find an eighty-five?” 
“I can order one. 
“One sheet. That’s two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?” 
“That’s easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half.” 
“I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg.” 
“Keep warm old man,” the boy said. “Remember we are in September.” 
“The month when the great fish come,” the old man said. “Anyone can be a fisherman in 
May.” 
“I go now for the sardines,” the boy said. 
When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy 
took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old 
man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still 
powerful although very old, and the neck was still 
strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen 
forward. His shirt had been patched so many ti
mes that it was like the sail and the patches were 
faded to many different shades by the sun. The [18] old man’s head was very old though and with 
his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The n
ewspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his 
arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted. 
The boy left him there and when he ca
me back the old man was still asleep. 
“Wake up old man,” the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man’s knees. 
The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away. 
Then he smiled. 
“What have you got?” he asked. 
“Supper,” said the boy. “We’
re going to have supper.” 
“I’m not very hungry.” 
“Come on and eat. You can’t fish and not eat.” 
“I have,” the old man said getting up and taking
 the newspaper and folding it. Then he started 
to fold the blanket. 
“Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You
’ll not fish without eating while I’m alive.” 
“Then live a long time and take care of your
self,” the old man said. “What are we eating?” 
“Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.” 
[19] The boy had brought them in a two-decker 
metal container from the Terrace. The two sets 
of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket 
with a paper napkin wrapped around each set. 
“Who gave this to you?” 
“Martin. The owner.” 
“I must thank him.” 
“I thanked him already,” the boy said. “You don’t need to thank him.” 
“I’ll give him the belly meat of a big fish,” the 
old man said. “Has he done this for us more than 
once?” 
“I think so.” 
“I must give him something more than the belly
 meat then. He is very thoughtful for us.” 
“He sent two beers.” 
“I like the beer in cans best.” 
“I know. But this is in bottles, Hatu
ey beer, and I take back the bottles.” 
“That’s very kind of you,” the old man said. “Should we eat?” 
“I’ve been asking you to,” the boy told him ge
ntly. “I have not wished to open the container 
until you were ready.” 
[20] “I’m ready now,” the old man said. “I only needed time to wash.” 
Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two streets down the road. 
I must have water here for him, the boy thou
ght, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so 
thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and 
another blanket. 
“Your stew is excellent,” the old man said. 
“Tell me about the baseball,” the boy asked him. 
“In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,” the old man said happily.” 
“They lost today,” the boy told him. 
“That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.” 
“They have other men on the team.” 
“Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and 
Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think 
of Dick Sisler and those great drives In the old 
park.” 
“There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen.” 
“Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace?” 
[21] “I wanted to take him fishing but I was t
oo timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him 
and you were too timid.” 
“I know. It was a great mistake. He might have 
gone with us. Then we would have that for all 
of our lives.” 
“I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,” the old man said. “They say his father was a 
fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand.” 
“The great Sisler’s father was never poor and he
, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues 
when he was my age.” 
“When I was your age I was befo
re the mast on a square rigged sh
ip that ran to Africa and I 
have seen lions on the beaches in the evening.” 
“I know. You told me.” 
“Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?” 
“Baseball I think,” the boy said. “Tell me about the great John J. McGraw.” He said Jota for J. 
“He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in
 the older days. But he was rough and harsh-
spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mi
nd was on horses as well as baseball. At least he 
carried lists of [22] horses at all times in his poc
ket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the 
telephone.” 
“He was a great manager,” the boy said. “My father thinks he was the greatest.” 
“Because he came here the most times,” the old man said. “If Durocher had continued to come 
here each year your father woul
d think him the greatest manager.” 
“Who is the greatest manager, rea
lly, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?” 
“I think they are equal.” 
“And the best fisherman is you.” 
“No. I know others better.” 
“Que Va,” the boy said. “There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is 
only you.” 
“Thank you. You make me happy.
 I hope no fish will come along so
 great that he will prove us 
wrong.” 
“There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.” 
“I may not be as strong as I think,” the old 
man said. “But I know many tricks and I have 
resolution.” 
“You ought to go to bed now so that you will be
 fresh in the morning. I will take the things 
back to the Terrace.” 
[23] “Good night then. I will wake you in the morning.” 
“You’re my alarm clock,” the boy said. 
“Age is my alarm clock,” the old man said. “Why 
do old men wake so early? Is it to have one 
longer day?” 
“I don’t know,” the boy said. “All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard.” 
“I can remember it,” the old man said. “I’ll waken you in time.” 
“I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior.” 
“I know.” 
“Sleep well old man.” 
The boy went out. They had eaten with no light
 on the table and the old man took off his 
trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled 
his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the 
newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that 
covered the springs of the bed. 
He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of
 Africa when he was a boy and the long golden 
beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt
 your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown 
mountains. He lived along that coast now every nigh
t and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and 
saw the native boats [24] come riding through it. 
He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he 
slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning. 
Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke
 up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But 
tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and 
went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Isla
nds rising from the sea and then he dreamed of 
the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands. 
He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women,
 nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, 
nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wi
fe. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions 
on the beach. They played like young cats in the d
usk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He 
never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled 
his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the 
boy. He was shivering with the morning cold. But 
he knew he would shiver himself warm and that 
soon he would be rowing. 
The door of the house where the boy lived was un
locked and he opened it and walked in quietly 
with his [25] bare feet. The boy was asleep on a co
t in the first room and the old man could see him 
clearly with the light that came in from the dying 
moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it 
until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his 
trousers from the chair by the bed an
d, sitting on the bed, pulled them on. 
The old man went out the door and the boy came 
after him. He was sleepy and the old man put 
his arm across his shoulders and said, “I am sorry.” 
“Qua Va,” the boy said. “It is what a man must do.” 
They walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot 
men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats. 
When they reached the old man’s shack the boy t
ook the rolls of line in the basket and the 
harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder. 
“Do you want coffee?” the boy asked. 
“We’ll put the gear in the boat and then get some.” 
They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. 
“How did you sleep old man?” the boy asked. He 
[26] was waking up now although it was still 
hard for him to leave his sleep. 
“Very well, Manolin,” the old man said. “I feel confident today.” 
“So do I,” the boy said. “Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits. He 
brings our gear himself. He neve
r wants anyone to carry anything.” 
“We’re different,” the old man said. “I let you carry things when you were five years old.” 
“I know it,” the boy said. “I’ll be right back
. Have another coffee. We have credit here.” 
He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. 
The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all 
he would have all day and he knew that he 
should take it. For a long time now eating had 
bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a 
bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day. 
The boy was back now with the sardines and th
e two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they 
went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled 
sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid 
her into the water. 
[27] “Good luck old man.” 
“Good luck,” the old man said. He fitted the rope 
lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, 
leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in 
the water, he began to row out of the harbour in 
the dark. There were other boats from the other be
aches going out to sea and the old man heard the 
dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills. 
Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip 
of the oars. They spread apart af
ter they were out of the mouth of 
the harbour and each one headed 
for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and 
he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean. 
He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf
 weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean 
that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms 
where all sorts of fish congregated because of the 
swirl the current made against the steep walls of 
the floor of the ocean. Here there were concentr
ations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes 
schools of squid in the deepest holes and these ro
se close to the surface at night where all the 
wandering fish fed on them. 
In the dark the old man could feel the morning 
coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling 
sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing th
at their stiff set wings made as they soared away 
in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish
 as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He 
was sorry for the birds, especially the small delica
te dark terns that were always flying and looking 
and almost never finding, and he thought, the bi
rds have a harder life than we do except for the 
robber birds and the heavy strong ones. Why did th
ey make birds so delicate and fine as those sea 
swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is ki
nd and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and 
it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are 
made too delicately for the sea. 
He always thought of the sea as 
la mar
 which is what people call her in Spanish when they love 
her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were 
a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those 
who used buoys as floats for their lines and had 
motorboats, bought [29] when the shark livers 
had brought much money, spoke of her as 
el mar 
which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contesta
nt or a place or even an enemy. But the old man 
always thought of her as feminine and as something 
that gave or withheld great favours, and if she 
did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a 
woman, he thought. 
He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for 
him since he kept well within his speed and the 
surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasi
onal swirls of the current. He was letting the 
current do a third of the work and 
as it started to be light he saw 
he was already further out than he 
had hoped to be at this hour.
